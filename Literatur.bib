abstract = {A synthetic route to prepare metal-semiconductor hybrid nanoparticles is presented, along with the possibility to tune the ratio of primary to secondary nucleation and the morphology of the semiconductor material grown on the metal nanoparticle seeds. Gold and cobalt-platinum nanoparticles are employed as metal seeds, on which CdS or CdSe is grown. Using transmission electron microscopy, absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), and powder X-ray diffraction as characterization techniques, a significant influence of chloride ions on the type of nucleation (that is, secondary or primary nucleation) as well as on the shape of the resulting heterostructures is observed. Partially replacing the commonly used cadmium precursor CdO by varying amounts of CdCl2 opens access to rod-like, multiarmed, flower-like, and bullet-like structures. The results suggest that neither pure CdO nor pure CdCl2 as precursors but only a mixture of both make these structures obtainable. In this article, the influence of the chloride ion concentration during semiconductor growth on metal seeds is investigated in depth. The morphology of the resulting heterostructures is characterized carefully, and a growth mechanism is suggested. Furthermore, it is shown that this synthetic approach can be transferred to seeds of various metals such as platinum, gold, and cobalt platinum.},

abstract = {Nonaqueous-solution routes to metal oxide nanoparticles are a valuable alternative to the known aqueous sol-gel processes, offering advantages such as high crystallinity at low temperatures, robust synthesis parameters and ability to control the crystal growth without the use of surfactants. In the first part of the review we give a detailed overview of the various solution routes to metal oxides in organic solvents, with a strong focus on surfactant-free processes. In most of these synthesis approaches, the organic solvent plays the role of the reactant that provides the oxygen for the metal oxide, controls the crystal growth, influences particle shape, and, in some cases, also determines the assembly behavior. We have a closer look at the following reaction systems in this order: 1) metal halides in alcohols, 2) metal alkoxides, acetates, and acetylacetonates in alcohols, 3) metal alkoxides in ketones, and 4) metal acetylacetonates in benzylamine. All these systems offer some peculiarities with respect to each other, providing many possibilities to control and tailor the particle size and shape, as well as the surface and assembly properties. In the second part we present general mechanistic principles for aqueous and nonaqueous sol-gel processes, followed by the discussion of reaction pathways relevant for nanoparticle formation in organic solvents. Depending on the system several mechanisms have been postulated: 1) alkyl halide elimination, 2) elimination of organic ethers, 3) ester elimination, 4) C--C bond formation between benzylic alcohols and alkoxides, 5) ketimine and aldol-like condensation reactions, 6) oxidation of metal nanoparticles, and 7) thermal decomposition methods.},

The chemistry and the crystallographic structure of the resulting films were examined as a function of growth (substrate) temperature. ZnS films were produced at growth temperatures above 250 °C and the resultant films were sulphur deficient (or zinc rich) and contained varying levels of residual carbon (≤14 at{\%}) and nitrogen ({\textless}2 at{\%}) contamination. Despite these relatively high contaminant levels, oriented crystalline films were produced at growth temperatures greater than 300 °C. The optical bandgap of the films was ≤3.6 eV, consistent with bulk cubic ZnS. A maximum crystallite size of approximately 50 nm was obtained at 400 °C.},

abstract = {We report a novel, non-hydrolytic route to ZnO nanocrystals by means of thermal decomposition of zinc acetate (ZnAc2) in alkylamines, in the presence of tert-butylphosphonic acid (TBPA). The slow heating of an alkylamine/TBPA/ZnAc2 mixture is a simple, safe, and scalable approach to synthesize ZnO nanocrystals from handy chemicals. The obtained ZnO nanocrystals were characterized by UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The growth of ZnO particles in the nanoscopic regime and their final size were governed by the TBPA/ZnAc2 molar ratio in the reaction mixtures. The various roles played by TBPA in the conditions of the synthesis are discussed on the basis of the experimental evidence. The presented synthetic approach provides a unique tool for designing the synthesis of ZnO crystals of a desired size in the nanoscale regime and can be potentially extended to other nanoscale materials.},

abstract = {We report for the first time the nonhydrolytic synthesis of soluble SnO2 nanocrystals, by the decomposition at temperatures between 230 and 250°C of tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate in diphenyl ether and in the presence of amines as surface capping agents. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies showed that highly crystalline nanoparticles were obtained with a mean size ranging from about 3 to about 3.5 nm, depending on the length of the alkyl chain of the amine. The use of metal 2-ethylhexanoate in the synthesis of oxide nanocrystals was generalized by preparing ZnO nanocrystals from the decomposition under similar conditions of zinc(II) 2-ethylhexanoate. In this case, soluble nanocrystals with a size ranging from about 5 to 8 nm were obtained. It is shown that the decomposition path of the precursor depends on the specific metal, and may result in the sudden formation of pyrolized products instead of soluble nanocrystals. The optical properties of capped SnO2 nanocrystals are reported for the first time and are characterized by only a blue luminescence, while for the ZnO colloids the photoluminescence spectra are characterized by the typical band-edge and surface defects emission bands, but in these samples the latter band is unusually much weaker than the former. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {We present a universal ethanolic one-step approach to noble/less noble metal aerogels at room temperature and −70 °C. We present a universal one-step approach to generate metal aerogels at room and at dry ice cold temperature, abbreviated as DICE. Performing the synthesis completely in an ethanolic phase allows for the formation of pure noble (Pt, Pd, Au and Ag) and less noble metal (Cu and Co) gels in a remarkably short period of time compared to the widespread aqueous synthesis strategies. Furthermore, three-dimensional disordered, porous networks were obtained for each system with high surface areas of 860 m 2 mol −1 for Ag up to 5470 m 2 mol −1 for Co. Additionally, it is shown that the low reaction temperature of −70 °C enables the control of the gelation time without losing the structural characteristics. Moreover, with respect to industrial applications, this facile, stabilizer-free synthesis yields large amounts of materials using highly concentrated precursor solutions. },

This capacitive enhancement is believed to arise from the Au-induced increase in electron transfer across the dumbbell-like NPs. Thise report demonstrates a new strategy to enhance oxide NP capacitance for applications in high performance supercapacitors.},
