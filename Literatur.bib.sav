abstract = {A synthetic route to prepare metal-semiconductor hybrid nanoparticles is presented, along with the possibility to tune the ratio of primary to secondary nucleation and the morphology of the semiconductor material grown on the metal nanoparticle seeds. Gold and cobalt-platinum nanoparticles are employed as metal seeds, on which CdS or CdSe is grown. Using transmission electron microscopy, absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis), and powder X-ray diffraction as characterization techniques, a significant influence of chloride ions on the type of nucleation (that is, secondary or primary nucleation) as well as on the shape of the resulting heterostructures is observed. Partially replacing the commonly used cadmium precursor CdO by varying amounts of CdCl2 opens access to rod-like, multiarmed, flower-like, and bullet-like structures. The results suggest that neither pure CdO nor pure CdCl2 as precursors but only a mixture of both make these structures obtainable. In this article, the influence of the chloride ion concentration during semiconductor growth on metal seeds is investigated in depth. The morphology of the resulting heterostructures is characterized carefully, and a growth mechanism is suggested. Furthermore, it is shown that this synthetic approach can be transferred to seeds of various metals such as platinum, gold, and cobalt platinum.},

abstract = {Nonaqueous-solution routes to metal oxide nanoparticles are a valuable alternative to the known aqueous sol-gel processes, offering advantages such as high crystallinity at low temperatures, robust synthesis parameters and ability to control the crystal growth without the use of surfactants. In the first part of the review we give a detailed overview of the various solution routes to metal oxides in organic solvents, with a strong focus on surfactant-free processes. In most of these synthesis approaches, the organic solvent plays the role of the reactant that provides the oxygen for the metal oxide, controls the crystal growth, influences particle shape, and, in some cases, also determines the assembly behavior. We have a closer look at the following reaction systems in this order: 1) metal halides in alcohols, 2) metal alkoxides, acetates, and acetylacetonates in alcohols, 3) metal alkoxides in ketones, and 4) metal acetylacetonates in benzylamine. All these systems offer some peculiarities with respect to each other, providing many possibilities to control and tailor the particle size and shape, as well as the surface and assembly properties. In the second part we present general mechanistic principles for aqueous and nonaqueous sol-gel processes, followed by the discussion of reaction pathways relevant for nanoparticle formation in organic solvents. Depending on the system several mechanisms have been postulated: 1) alkyl halide elimination, 2) elimination of organic ethers, 3) ester elimination, 4) C--C bond formation between benzylic alcohols and alkoxides, 5) ketimine and aldol-like condensation reactions, 6) oxidation of metal nanoparticles, and 7) thermal decomposition methods.},

The chemistry and the crystallographic structure of the resulting films were examined as a function of growth (substrate) temperature. ZnS films were produced at growth temperatures above 250 °C and the resultant films were sulphur deficient (or zinc rich) and contained varying levels of residual carbon (≤14 at{\%}) and nitrogen ({\textless}2 at{\%}) contamination. Despite these relatively high contaminant levels, oriented crystalline films were produced at growth temperatures greater than 300 °C. The optical bandgap of the films was ≤3.6 eV, consistent with bulk cubic ZnS. A maximum crystallite size of approximately 50 nm was obtained at 400 °C.},

abstract = {We report a novel, non-hydrolytic route to ZnO nanocrystals by means of thermal decomposition of zinc acetate (ZnAc2) in alkylamines, in the presence of tert-butylphosphonic acid (TBPA). The slow heating of an alkylamine/TBPA/ZnAc2 mixture is a simple, safe, and scalable approach to synthesize ZnO nanocrystals from handy chemicals. The obtained ZnO nanocrystals were characterized by UV-vis absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The growth of ZnO particles in the nanoscopic regime and their final size were governed by the TBPA/ZnAc2 molar ratio in the reaction mixtures. The various roles played by TBPA in the conditions of the synthesis are discussed on the basis of the experimental evidence. The presented synthetic approach provides a unique tool for designing the synthesis of ZnO crystals of a desired size in the nanoscale regime and can be potentially extended to other nanoscale materials.},

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies showed that highly crystalline nanoparticles were obtained with a mean size ranging from about 3 to about 3.5 nm, depending on the length of the alkyl chain of the amine. The use of metal 2-ethylhexanoate in the synthesis of oxide nanocrystals was generalized by preparing ZnO nanocrystals from the decomposition under similar conditions of zinc(II) 2-ethylhexanoate. In this case, soluble nanocrystals with a size ranging from about 5 to 8 nm were obtained. It is shown that the decomposition path of the precursor depends on the specific metal, and may result in the sudden formation of pyrolized products instead of soluble nanocrystals. The optical properties of capped SnO2 nanocrystals are reported for the first time and are characterized by only a blue luminescence, while for the ZnO colloids the photoluminescence spectra are characterized by the typical band-edge and surface defects emission bands, but in these samples the latter band is unusually much weaker than the former. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

We present a universal one-step approach to generate metal aerogels at room and at dry ice cold temperature, abbreviated as DICE. Performing the synthesis completely in an ethanolic phase allows for the formation of pure noble (Pt, Pd, Au and Ag) and less noble metal (Cu and Co) gels in a remarkably short period of time compared to the widespread aqueous synthesis strategies. Furthermore, three-dimensional disordered, porous networks were obtained for each system with high surface areas of 860 m 2 mol −1 for Ag up to 5470 m 2 mol −1 for Co. Additionally, it is shown that the low reaction temperature of −70 °C enables the control of the gelation time without losing the structural characteristics. Moreover, with respect to industrial applications, this facile, stabilizer-free synthesis yields large amounts of materials using highly concentrated precursor solutions. },

Prototypical biomolecules, such as D-biotin and streptavidin pair, were utilized to connect NPs and NWs in solution. It was found that Au NPs form a dense shell around a CdTe NW. The superstructure demonstrated unusual optical effects related to the long-distance interaction of the semiconductor and noble metal nanocolloids. The NW-NP complex showed 5-fold enhancement of luminescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission peak as compared to unconjugated NW. The system was theoretically examined in a simple model of CdTe NW coaxially surrounded by an Au shell, which gives excellent agreement with experimental data. The combination of time-resolved luminescence and calculations demonstrated that increase of fluorescence intensity occurs due to stimulation of photon emission by an electromagnetic field generated around the Au NP. The process is reminiscent of SERS, although displaying smaller enhancement factors. Importantly, the luminescence enhancement should be treated as a collective response of Au-NPs, rather than a result of isolated NP-NW interactions.},

The core–shell aerogels exhibited largely improved Pt utilization efficiencies for the oxygen reduction reaction and their activities show a volcano-type relationship as a function of the lattice parameter of the core substrate. The maximum mass and specific activities are 5.25 A mgPt−1 and 2.53 mA cm−2, which are 18.7 and 4.1 times higher than those of Pt/C, respectively, demonstrating the superiority of the core–shell metallic aerogels.

  abstract  = {The direct cross-linking of Au/Ag alloy nanoparticles (NPs) into high surface area, mesoporous Au/Ag aerogels via chemical oxidation of the surface ligands is reported. The precursor alloy NPs with composition-tunable morphologies were produced by galvanic replacement of the preformed Ag hollow NPs. The effect of Au:Ag molar ratio on the NP morphology and surface plasmon resonance has been thoroughly investigated and resulted in smaller Au/Ag alloy NPs (4-8 nm), larger Au/Ag alloy hollow NPs (40-45 nm), and Au/Ag alloy hollow particles decorated with smaller Au NPs (2-5 nm). The oxidative removal of surfactant ligands, followed by supercritical drying, is utilized to construct large (centimeter to millimeter) self-supported Au/Ag alloy aerogels. The resultant assemblies exhibit high surface areas (67-73 m2/g), extremely low densities (0.051-0.055 g/cm3), and interconnected mesoporous (2-50 nm) networks, making them of great interest for a number of new technologies. The influence of mesoporous gel morphology on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been studied using Rhodamine 101 (Rd 101) as the probe molecule. The alloy aerogels exhibit SERS signal intensities that are 10-42 times higher than those achieved from the precursor Au/Ag alloy NPs. The Au/Ag alloy aerogel III exhibits SERS sensing capability down to 1 nM level. The increased signal intensities attained for alloy aerogels are attributed to highly porous gel morphology and enhanced surface roughness that can potentially generate a large number of plasmonic hot spots, creating efficient SERS substrates for future applications.},

In this Review we summarize recent progress in the field of photochemical catalysis on plasmonic metallic nanostructures.

Powder X-ray diffraction indicates that the average crystallite size is on the order of 2nm in 100°C heated aerogels, but increases to nearly 16nm upon heating at 500°C. This increase in size is accompanied by a phase change from the cubic to the hexagonal structure. The optical bandgap (measured by absorption onset) is also tunable with heat treatment, and was found to range from 2.2-2.8eV. The photoluminescence excitation spectrum ($\lambda$ ex = 400nm) of a 100°C-heated CdS aerogel is similar to that of the nanoparticulate starting materials, exhibiting both a sharp excitonic peak near 450nm corresponding to band edge emission, and a broad feature in the region 500-700nm, attributed to electron-hole recombination at trap states. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The mesosized voids generated through the in situ galvanic replacement reaction and the macrosized porous systems make a great contribution to the increased number of active sites. First-principle calculations revealed the intrinsic optimized binding energy of Ir by alloying with Cu. The best catalytic performance necessities a balance of the adsorption and desorption energy.

We systematically characterize the position of the resonance peaks associated with the same set of individual silver nanoparticles embedded sequentially in index oils with increasing refractive index. This technique effectively allows the local refractive index to be stepped in increments of 0.04. As the local index is increased, the spectrum from each of the nanoparticles generally undergoes a very regular and reproducible red shift; however, we find that the amount of red shift per index increase varies depending on the shape of the nanoparticle and the mode of excitation. In particular, we find that the spectral peak that occurs in triangular nanoparticles exhibits a noticeably larger red shift than that associated with the dipole mode corresponding to spherical nanoparticles. Our results are consistent with experiments performed on ensembles of similar nanoparticles and suggest that individual nanoparticles may be utilized in biosensing applications where currently ensembles are being investigated.},

Anion adsorption leads to strong damping of the free electron absorption. Cathodic polarization leads to anion desorption. Underpotential deposition (upd) of electropositive metal layers results in dramatic blue-shifts of the surface plasmon band of the substrate. The deposition of just 0.1 monolayer can be readily detected by eye. In some cases alloying occurs spontaneously during upd. Alloy formation can be ascertained from the optical absorption spectrum in the case of gold deposition onto silver sols. The underpotential deposition of silver adatoms onto palladium leads to the formation of a homogeneous silver shell, but the mean free path is less than predicted, due to lattice strain in the shell.},

The value of this diffusion coefficient lies in the range 7-8 × 10−6 cm.2/sec. for both media. The application of this method for estimating diffusion coefficients is valid for any colloidal system that is characterized by a small particle size distribution at all stages of its growth. 6.
