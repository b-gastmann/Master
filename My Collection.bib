abstract = {Monolithic aerogels composed of cadmium sulfide nanoparticles partially modified with metallic gold (CdS-Au) are reported. The semiconductor-metal nanoparticles are synthesized using an inverse micelle media of Bis-(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate sodium salt (AOT) in heptane, followed by capping with 4-fluorothiophenol and precipitation with triethylamine. The nanoparticles are then dispersed in acetone and gel formation is achieved using nanoparticle condensation strategy. The resultant CdS-Au aerogel materials are mesoporous, with an interconnected network of semiconductor-metal nanoparticles. A detailed microstructure analysis of the semiconductor-metal aerogels via transmission electron microscopy indicates that the final gold concentration significantly impacts the semiconductor-metal aerogel morphology and porosity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
